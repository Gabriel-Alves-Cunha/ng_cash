# NG.Cash Challenge

## Run

Before all, you should have at least Node, Yarn and optionally Docker.

To run this dual project package you have a few options:

- **Install dependencies**, type in your terminal `yarn`.

- **To run without Docker**, type in your terminal on the root folder of this package: `yarn dev`.

- **To run with Docker**, assuming you have docker on your machine, type at your terminal, on the './server' folder: `yarn build`. Then, to start the docker image, type: `yarn start:docker`. On another terminal, on the './web' folder, type `yarn dev`.

You should your app running on your machine!
